Hello! Cat Butler here.

I joined School of Code in 2024 as a Bootcamp Facilitator. My role is focused on creating a great environment and course experience, where bootcampers feel both challenged and empowered, 
but also that they are in safe hands and in the best learning experience of their lives. Having been a Bootcamper myself and I know how transformational a journey and feel passionately about making it a great experience for all. 

Before transitioning to tech, my background was in the arts industry where I spent 7 years freelancing as a performer, project manager, relationship builder, and strategist working at local, national, and international levels. 
I love dancing, live music, cooking, reading, spending time with loved ones, and meeting new people, preferably outdoors and preferably at a festival.

As a person, I am interested in creating empowered, connected, creative communities founded on change, curiosity and fun.
